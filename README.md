# pythonChallenge
There's 2 different assignments in this repository. 
In each folder there is a main.py file which contains the python code to each of the assignments, 
an analysis folder that contains the results printed out, and a resources folder that contains the used csv file.
Each folder also contains a README.md with comments about every step of the python code.
